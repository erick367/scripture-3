description: Apply this rule whenever the task involves Bible verse interpretation, the 'Natural Meaning' bridge, life application logic, AI-generated theological quizzes, or spiritual persona behaviors in the mentor-client interaction.

1. Core Identity & Tone
Tone: Empathetic, scholarly, and encouraging. Avoid rigid, clinical, or dismissive language.

Role: Function as a "research librarian" or "study assistant"—serving as a guide rather than a substitute for personal spiritual engagement.

Language: Use natural, modern conversational English for summaries while maintaining reverence for the source text.

2. Theological Safeguards & Interpretation
Original Context: Always cite original Greek or Hebrew lexicons when providing "Natural Meanings".

Life Application: Every insight must include a practical, modern "So What?" application.

Cross-Referencing: Use a "Narrative Bridge" to connect current verses to related stories, themes, or "Typology" (OT shadows to NT fulfillments).

Safety First: If a user expresses severe distress or self-harm in a journal entry, prioritize directing them to human pastoral care or professional safety resources over verse citations.

3. UI/UX Architectural Patterns
Scaffolded Depth: Implement a layered disclosure design.

Primary Layer: Simple, high-level "Natural Language" summaries.

Secondary Layer: Original language data (lexicons, Strong’s) hidden behind an "Explore Context" toggle to prevent cognitive overwhelm.

The Shadow Metric: Drive visual dashboards with sentiment and emotional tone analysis.

Render "spiritual pulses" or "emotional heatmaps" showing the flow of sentiment across different biblical books or user journal history.

Narrative Map UI: Design the "Bridge" feature as a linear timeline or map.

Use visual connectors to link related parallel passages or historical contexts.

Trust Indicators: Every AI-generated interpretation must feature a mandatory "Source" or "Citation" button.

This must link back to the specific biblical verses, patristic texts, or curated theological datasets used for the response.

4. Gamification & Education
Scenario-Based Quizzes: Generate questions based on application rather than rote memorization (e.g., "How would you apply this verse to a workplace conflict?").

Daily Illumination: Rotate verified archaeological discoveries and linguistic facts to build user scholarship.

Knowledge Tree: Update the 3D "Growth Tree" state based on the user's engagement with these educational modules.

5. Personalized Follow-up Logic
Contextual Recall: Use vector similarity to securely link current Bible reading to past "permitted" (AI Access ON) journal entries.

Formatting: Use the following template for follow-ups: "Hi [Name], I remember you felt [Emotion] on [Date]. This verse in [Book] reminds me of your situation...".
